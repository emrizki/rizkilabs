I think it's worth investing some time customizing your vscode editor.

First, I'll show you how to adjust the color theme, so go to your vscode editor.

Then on Windows, go to **File -> Preferences -> Color Theme**.

On Mac, it's the same thing, but you would go to the **Code** menu instead.

And then you can cycle through the color themes and choose the one that you like.

As I cycled through each theme, to be quite honest with you, none of these themes really appealed to me. The one that I like to use is called **Brackets Dark**, but it's not made readily available when you first install vscode, which means we have to go to the marketplace and there we can install it as an extension.

So here we're going to look for Brackets Dark. In my opinion, it's the best color thing we can use, so we're going to click on this and install it. Once you install it, you can set the color theme.

And if you were to go back to your **Preferences**, notice that we can now see it there.

All right, let's see how it affects our code. And I think this looks really nice.
I really like this theme because it's easy on the eyes and it doesn't use up too much color.

And the contrast between orange and blue is very good for those that have color vision deficiencies.
This is actually the best thing that I've used before. But if you want a list of other cool themes, you can check [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=color%20theme&target=vscode&category=Themes&sortBy=Relevance).

But in all honesty, this one is the best. The only other thing you can really play with is the font size, so once again, you would go to **File -> Preferences**.

For Mac once again, go to the **Code** menu instead, then click on preferences, but in
any case, **Preferences** and **Settings**.

And here you can adjust the font size. A good font size is typically between 14 and 20. It really depends on your eyesight and the size of your screen.

So I suggest just, you know, play around with it and keep doing so until you find a size that works for you. I personally use a font size of 20.

All right, that's all I hope you took the time to change your color theme and the font size.
